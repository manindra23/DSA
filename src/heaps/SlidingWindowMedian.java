/*
Given an integer array, nums, and an integer, k, there is a sliding window of size k, which is moving from the very left to the very right of the array.
We can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
Given this scenario, return the median of the each window. Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted.

Constraints:
    * 1<=k<=nums.length<=10^3
    * -2^31 <=nums[i]<=(2^31)-1
